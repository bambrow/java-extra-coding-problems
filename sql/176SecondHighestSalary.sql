/*
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

/*
Schema:

Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100');
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200');
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300');
*/

# 额，我觉得没啥好解释的，直接看语句吧。

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee where Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee)
