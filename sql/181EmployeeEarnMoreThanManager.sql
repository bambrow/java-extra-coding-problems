/*
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.Name as Employee from Employee as e1, Employee as e2 where e1.ManagerId = e2.Id and e1.Salary > e2.salary

# Another solution
select e1.Name as Employee from Employee e1 join Employee e2 on (e1.ManagerId = e2.Id) where e1.Salary > e2.Salary
